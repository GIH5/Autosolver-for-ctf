# Autosolver-for-ctf
Automate solving ctf challenges through scripts.
## Why?
I did this to get better python scripting skills and to automate things and it makes playing ctf's a lot more fun
## SPOILERS
This repo is obviously going to contain spoilers for ctf challenges and the goal of these scripts is to IMMEDIATELY capture the flag with very little to no  effort, hence the name 'Autosolver'.  
## Future updates (as of 3/31/2023)
**Updates will be made and met mostly on weekends** 
  .Mino-autosolver has a slight update. Only captures the flag after getting loggining as another account. I will implement a function to fetch the flag   from the ftp server.
