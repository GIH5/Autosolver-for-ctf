# Autosolver-for-ctf
Automate solving ctf challenges through scripts.
## Why?
I did this to get better python skills
## SPOILERS
This repo is obviously going to contain spoilers for ctf challenges and the goal of these scripts is to IMMEDIATELY capture the flag with very little to no  effort, hence the name 'Autosolver'. 
## Web
If a ctf has a web phase and priv esc phase i will only be covering the web phase.
