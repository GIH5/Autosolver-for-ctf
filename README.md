# Autosolver-for-ctf
Automate solving ctf challenges through scripts.
## Why?
I did this to get better python scripting skills and to automate things
## SPOILERS
This repo is obviously going to contain spoilers for ctf challenges and the goal of these scripts is to IMMEDIATELY capture the flag with very little to no  effort, hence the name 'Autosolver'. 
## Web
I will only be covering the web phase of ctf.
